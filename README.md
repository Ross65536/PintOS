# Pintos
Labs for undergraduate OS class (600.318) at Johns Hopkins. [Pintos](http://pintos-os.org) 
is a teaching operating system for x86, challenging but not overwhelming, small
but realistic enough to understand OS in depth (it can run x86 machine and simulators 
including QEMU, Bochs and VMWare Player!). The main source code, documentation and assignments 
are developed by Ben Pfaff and others from Stanford (refer to its [LICENSE](./LICENSE)).

## Changes
The course instructor ([Ryan Huang](huang@cs.jhu.edu)) made some changes to the original
Pintos labs to tailor for his class. They include:
* Tweaks to Makefiles for tool chain configuration and some new targets
* Make qemu image and run it in non-test mode.
* Misc

**This is the upstream branch to track the changes. For students, please clone
or download the release version from [here](https://github.com/jhu-cs318/pintos.git)
to work on the projects.**

## Setup
We wrote a [guide](https://cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall17/project/setup.html) on 
how to setup the toolchain and development environment to work on Pintos projects.
